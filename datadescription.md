It contains the ID of the parent location. Conditionally Required: Required for locations which are entrances (location_type=2), generic nodes (location_type=3) or boarding areas (location_type=4). Optional for stops/platforms (location_type=0). Forbidden for stations (location_type=1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If the location has a parent station, it inherits the parent station¡¯s timezone instead of applying its own. Stations and parentless stops with empty stop_timezone inherit the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone. The times provided in stop_times.txt are in the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone, not stop_timezone. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Valid options are: For parentless stops: 0 or empty - No accessibility information for the stop, 1 - Some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair, 2 - Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop. For child stops: 0 or empty - Stop will inherit its wheelchair_boarding behavior from the parent station, if specified in the parent, 1 - There exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform, 2 - There exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform. For station entrances/exits: 0 or empty - Station entrance will inherit its wheelchair_boarding behavior from the parent station, if specified for the parent, 1 - Station entrance is wheelchair accessible, 2 - No accessible path from station entrance to stops/platforms. |

If exact arrival and departure times (timepoint=1 or empty) are not available, estimated or interpolated arrival and departure times (timepoint=0) should be provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| stop_id                      | Foreign ID referencing stops.stop_id                     | Conditionally Required  | Identifies the serviced stop. All stops serviced during a trip must have a record in stop_times.txt. Referenced locations must be stops/platforms, i.e. their stops.location_type value must be 0 or empty. A stop may be serviced multiple times in the same trip, and multiple trips and routes may service the same stop. On-demand service using stops should be referenced in the sequence in which service is available at those stops. A data consumer should assume that travel is possible from one stop or location to any stop or location later in the trip, provided that the pickup/drop_off_type of each stop_time and the time constraints of each start/end_pickup_drop_off_window do not forbid it. Conditionally Required: Required if stop_times.location_group_id AND stop_times.location_id are NOT defined. Forbidden if stop_times.location_group_id or stop_times.location_id are defined. |
| location_group_id            | Foreign ID referencing location_groups.location_group_id | Conditionally Forbidden | Identifies the serviced location group that indicates groups of stops where riders may request pickup or drop off. All location groups serviced during a trip must have a record in stop_times.txt. Multiple trips and routes may service the same location group. On-demand service using location groups should be referenced in the sequence in which service is available at those location groups. A data consumer should assume that travel is possible from one stop or location to any stop or location later in the trip, provided that the pickup/drop_off_type of each stop_time and the time constraints of each start/end_pickup_drop_off_window do not forbid it. Conditionally Forbidden: Forbidden if stop_times.stop_id or stop_times.location_id are defined.                                                                                                                                     |
| location_id                  | Foreign ID referencing id from locations.geojson         | Conditionally Forbidden | Identifies the GeoJSON location that corresponds to serviced zone where riders may request pickup or drop off. All GeoJSON locations serviced during a trip must have a record in stop_times.txt. Multiple trips and routes may service the same GeoJSON location. On-demand service within locations should be referenced in the sequence in which service is available in those locations. A data consumer should assume that travel is possible from one stop or location to any stop or location later in the trip, provided that the pickup/drop_off_type of each stop_time and the time constraints of each start/end_pickup_drop_off_window do not forbid it. Conditionally Forbidden: Forbidden if stop_times.stop_id or stop_times.location_group_id are defined.                                                                                                                                          |
| stop_sequence                | Non-negative integer                                     | Required                | Order of stops, location groups, or GeoJSON locations for a particular trip. The values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive. Example: The first location on the trip could have a stop_sequence=1, the second location on the trip could have a stop_sequence=23, the third location could have a stop_sequence=40, and so on. Travel within the same location group or GeoJSON location requires two records in stop_times.txt with the same location_group_id or location_id.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This field overrides the default trips.trip_headsign when the headsign changes between stops. If the headsign is displayed for an entire trip, trips.trip_headsign should be used instead. A stop_headsign value specified for one stop_time does not apply to subsequent stop_times in the same trip. If you want to override the trip_headsign for multiple stop_times in the same trip, the stop_headsign value must be repeated in each stop_time row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| shape_pt_sequence   | Non-negative integer | Required | Sequence in which the shape points connect to form the shape. Values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive. Example: If the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the shapes.txt file might contain these records to define the shape: shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0 A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6 A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| shape_dist_traveled | Non-negative float   | Optional | Actual distance traveled along the shape from the first shape point to the point specified in this record. Used by trip planners to show the correct portion of the shape on a map. Values must increase along with shape_pt_sequence; they must not be used to show reverse travel along a route. Distance units must be consistent with those used in stop_times.txt. Recommended for routes that have looping or inlining (the vehicle crosses or travels over the same portion of alignment in one trip). If a vehicle retraces or crosses the route alignment at points in the course of a trip, shape_dist_traveled is important to clarify how portions of the points in shapes.txt line up correspond with records in stop_times.txt. Example: If a bus travels along the three points defined above for A_shp, the additional shape_dist_traveled values (shown here in kilometers) would look like this: shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence,shape_dist_traveled A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0,0 A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6,6.8310 A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11,15.8765 |
